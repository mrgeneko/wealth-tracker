1. during regular trading hours, an update from cnbc for SCHG displayed
as after-hours
2. switching between multiple watchlists on investing.com is broken

TODO:
0. Use https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-securities-auctions-data/treasury-securities-auctions-data
to determine treasury listing

https://stockanalysis.com/list/nyseamerican-stocks/
https://stockanalysis.com/list/sp-500-stocks/

1. symbols assume US stock markets. how to handle other exchanges?
2. change scrapers to work with ticker without url where possible
3. create demo assets_liabilities (without need for investing.com watchlist).
4. can some single quote pages be left open and monitored?
5. create intraday history of total net worth and draw a graph
6. add crud from web page, history of assets over time.
7. when new ticker added from web, need a way to retrieve pricing,
   potentially send price from web to mysql table, or scraper daemon
8. export data from web or mysql?

should there be multiple 'logins'?
